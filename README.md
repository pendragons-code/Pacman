# This Project

I originally found this project on a discord server of an account I lost. This server was primarily full of developers learning from each other and it was deleted after a rogue admin, turned owner deleted the server. I'm not sure what happened to it and shortly later, the github repo hosting this was deleted. The only known copy of that repo that I have is this. I remembered that that repo was originally cloned and over the few years this thing has sat down in my PC for a looooooooooooooooong time. While I do not have the original, I hope that someone could find it! I seached online and it seems that https://github.com/bward2/pacman-js is the original. That said I heavily modified this and intend to credit the original creators.

# other stuff

I will update the [site](https://game.senghong.xyz) I'm hosting it on to credit the original creators. I was also too lazy to play around with gulp due to the major breaking changes that will affect the hosting of this game,

# TODOS
get it working on safari

# If you noticed

So yes the site im hosting the instance of this on (repl.it) has a slightly different .mp3 file, why? For some reason during a change in replit, where old repls would break, some files got deleted and due to said change i had to remake a new repl, I found a ROM dump for a few of the sounds and got the thing working, as of this readme update, I have added in the sounds from the original repo to the site!


# how to run

# how did i find it?

I didn't my old friend cloned it and put it on gitlabs and here i was looking in the wrong place. One day he googled a line of code and ended up finding a fork of a fork (a fork was used to pr someone's fork) that led me to an original. Yeah get that.
