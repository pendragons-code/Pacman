# This Project

I originally found this project on a discord server of an account I lost. This server was primarily full of developers learning from each other and it was deleted after a rogue admin, turned owner deleted the server. I'm not sure what happened to it and shortly later, the github repo hosting this was deleted. The only known copy of that repo that I have is this. I remembered that that repo was originally cloned and over the few years this thing has sat down in my PC for a looooooooooooooooong time. While I do not have the original, I hope that someone could find it! I seached online and it seems that https://github.com/bward2/pacman-js is the original. That said I heavily modified this and intend to credit the original creators.

# other stuff

I will update the [site](https://game.senghong.xyz) I'm hosting it on to credit the original creators. I was also too lazy to play around with gulp due to the major breaking changes that will affect the hosting of this game,

# TODOS
